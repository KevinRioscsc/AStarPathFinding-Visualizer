# AStarPathFinding-Visualizer
I wanted to use the a star pathfinding algorithm for a game idea that I had involving AI's that follow the user. So I decided to learn the algorithm by creating a visualizer to help me understand this algorithm. The main data structure I used was arraylist as it's extremely easy to use and I can retrieve and add data dynamically, which was perfect for my game idea. It was also my First time working with JPanel and JFrame in java. Prior projects only required me to create simulations with the command prompt. So visually representing a complicated algorithm was a huge task for me.
